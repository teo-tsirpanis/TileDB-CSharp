# TileDB Experimental C# API â€” Level 1

This branch contains the design for the next generation of the TileDB C# API.

    * Follows .NET conventions and idioms.
    * Is easy to use and understand.
    * Is efficient.
    * Is safe.
    * Its features are discoverable.
    * Hides the complexity of the underlying C API.
* Require few if any changes to the TileDB C API.
